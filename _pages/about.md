I obtained my PhD from the University of Edinburgh and am currently employed there as a Research Assistant in Coastal Numerical Modelling. With strong academic foundations in both ocean engineering and computer science, my expertise spans ocean numerical modelling (waves and tidal currents), wave-turbulence decomposition, and AI/ML based wave prediction. In addition, I have extensive experience in physical scale model testing of ocean structures as well as in data analysis. This multidisciplinary background equips me with a well-rounded perspective to tackle complex challenges. I have authored and presented research at international conferences and have published in peer-reviewed papers.
