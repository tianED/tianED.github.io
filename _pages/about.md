I obtained my PhD from the University of Edinburgh and am currently employed there as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Hydro-Environment Modelling for Tidal Stream Energy. My current research with [CoTide Project](https://cotide.ac.uk/) focuses on the hydrodynamic mechanisms that influence tidal stream energy resources and tidal array design, using open-source modelling tools such as TELEMAC and Thetis. Prior to this role, I also gained experiences as Research Assistant in two areas: coastal numerical modelling and physical scale model testing of marine energy systems.

My academic background combines ocean engineering and computer science, equipping me with a multidisciplinary approach to complex offshore engineering challenges. I hold an MSc with Distinction in Sustainable Energy Systems (2020) from the University of Edinburgh, with a focus on offshore renewable energy. Prior to that, I earned dual BEng degrees in Ocean Engineering and Computer Science from Dalian University of Technology, China (2019).

With a strong foundation in both physics-based and data-driven approaches, my expertise spans: **• ocean/coastal modelling** (waves and tidal currents) **• wave-current interactions** **• machine learning based wave prediction** **• physical scale model testing**

I am passionate about bridging theoretical research with real-world engineering applications. If you're interested in my work or potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
